    <h1>Hello Uncle CJ, glad you were able to find the next clue. For the next combination, you will be visiting a few classic movies.</h1>

    <p>In the movie “The Breakfast Club,” when Bender closes the door during Saturday School, the principal gets mad when he realizes what has happened. He assigns a number of detentions to Bender, when he asks the principal, “How many is that?” Brian answers with a number. Take this number, multiply it by two, and that is the first number to one of the locks on the box.</p>

    <p>In the movie “Pulp Fiction,” when Vincent is discussing Marsellus Wallace, he mentions that Marsellus threw Tony Rocky Horror out of a _____ story building. The number of floors that this building is tall is the second number to the same lock on the box.</p>

    <p>In the movie “The Dark Knight,” Batman arrives at one of the Joker’s crime scenes where two people are murdered with similar names to Harvey Dent. After the police arrive, Batman says “I need ___ minutes with the scene before your men contaminate it.” This number of minutes is the third number to the same lock on the box.</p>

    <p>Good luck!</p>
